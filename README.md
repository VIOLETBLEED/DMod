# BladeCYN/DMod - Difference

```diff
- Random blink packet kick
+ More customization
- Bannable/useless features for the general dupians. See the originial repository if you require that
```

**This does NOT contain any additional exploit integration, as Gatekeep() - however it will be nicer to use as a Quality of Life tool.**

# DMod

A Minecraft mod used for finding exploits on Hypixel. <br>
Read the code at your own risk as it is trauma inducing.
