Due to, well, very much forseen circumstances, we are in the process of rewriting most of DMod from the ground up over in the development branch.

As such, bug fixes, and new updates, are likely to be sparse until the work is done, which I expect to be sometime in ~~May 2024~~ will be when it will be, basically.

# bladecyn/DMod - Difference

Due to the state of ratting in the cheating community, releases will be only published via GitHub Actions CI. 
I don't condone ratting (obviously), or even cheating in general. This is a tool for finding exploits, and should be used as such.

If in doubt, do NOT run it. If there is a risk to you, it's not worth it.
There is nothing malicious in this repository, however third parties have been known to modify DModification.
```diff
+ Architectury Loom (yay no more ancient gradle)
+ More customization (Prefix)
+ Kotlin DSL (Gradle)
- Random blink packet kick
- Bannable/useless features for the general dupians. See the originial repository if you require that
+ Added GUI blink mode, which only blinks GUI packets, and not movement - this can prevent some falsy bans. Packet list is in DMod.kt
```

Please stop using /macrogui wrong, to do a GUI with a space in the title, either run without specifying a GUI parameter (next gui will be the title) or use an `_` for a space.

## How to hunt for exploits?
- Read (GUIDE.md)[https://github.com/bladecyn/DMod/blob/master/GUIDE.md]

**This does NOT contain any additional exploit integration, as Gatekeep() - however it will be nicer to use as a Quality of Life tool.**

# D (The D stands for DeMarcus) Mod - Original README

A Minecraft mod used for finding exploits on Hypixel. <br>
Read the code at your own risk as it is trauma inducing.
