# bladecyn/DMod - Difference

Due to the state of ratting in the cheating community, releases will be only published via GitHub Actions CI. 
I don't condone ratting (obviously), or even cheating in general. This is a tool for finding exploits, and should be used as such.

If in doubt, do NOT run it. If there is a risk to you, it's not worth it.
There is nothing malicious in this repository, however third parties have been known to modify DModification.
```diff
+ Architectury Loom (yay no more ancient gradle)
+ More customization (Prefix)
+ Kotlin DSL (Gradle)
- Random blink packet kick
- Bannable/useless features for the general dupians. See the originial repository if you require that
+ Added GUI blink mode, which only blinks GUI packets, and not movement - this can prevent some falsy bans. Packet list is in DMod.kt
```

## How to hunt for exploits?
- Read (GUIDE.md)[https://github.com/bladecyn/DMod/blob/master/GUIDE.md]

**This does NOT contain any additional exploit integration, as Gatekeep() - however it will be nicer to use as a Quality of Life tool.**

# D (The D stands for DeMarcus) Mod - Original README

A Minecraft mod used for finding exploits on Hypixel. <br>
Read the code at your own risk as it is trauma inducing.
